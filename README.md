# Needs refactoring:

## Setup

1. Run the install script:

        curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schroeder-robert/vantelligence_connector/develop/install.sh | sudo bash

2. Choose on of the config files in the `connector/config` folder and rename it to `config.yaml`.

    Alternatively you can build your own config from the blocks from `Supported devices/sensors/programs` if you use a custom setup.

3. Restart & you're ready

<br>

## Running

After successfull start you will see some new topics in yout MQTT broker.

Your configuration will be published in this topic:

    connector/config

All entities and their states will be published here:

    connector/devices

<br>

## Supported devices/sensors/programs

You can add this config blocks to your `config.yaml` to activate MQTT publishing to your broker.
Every device has at least an `id` and a `name` which you can define. That way ist is possible to read two oder more sensors of the same type.
